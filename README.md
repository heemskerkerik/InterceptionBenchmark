# InterceptionBenchmark
A benchmark between different IoC and interception methods.

This small research project benchmarks between different IoC frameworks and their preferred method of interception. Currently the following frameworks are benchmarked:
* Unity with Unity.Interception
* SimpleInjector with Castle.DynamicProxy
* Castle.DynamicProxy stand-alone
* SimpleInjector with MethodTimer.Fody

What is being benchmarked is as follows:
* Creating or resolving `ISomething`;
* Calling `ISomething.Foo` on the resulting object;
* Timing the duration of the original method using a `Stopwatch`, either via interception or encapsulation (in a `TimingSomething`).

A benchmark on my machine (i7 6700HQ, 16 GB) results in the following, YMMV:

Method |         Median |        StdDev |   Scaled | Place |

UsingNew |     57.8832 ns |     0.6876 ns |     1.00 |     1 |

UsingAutofacWithInterception | 16,533.7070 ns |   444.3598 ns |   285.64 |     8 |
UsingUnityWithInterception | 89,815.6019 ns | 1,188.6651 ns | 1,551.67 |     9 |

For reference:

* A nanosecond (ns) is a billionth of a second;
* A microsecond (us or Âµs) is 1,000 nanoseconds;
* A millisecond (ms) is 1,000 microseconds or 1,000,000 nanoseconds.

Benchmarking is done using the excellent [BenchmarkDotNet](https://github.com/PerfDotNet/BenchmarkDotNet) package.
